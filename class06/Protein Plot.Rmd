```{r}
# This function takes input of a protein pdb id number and outputs a plot for the protein. It reads the pdb data of the protein, trims the pdb data to a subset of atoms and generates a protein plot. To use this function, it must be called with a pdb id passed in as the only argument.
proteinPlot <- function(number) {
  # load the bio3d library
  library(bio3d)
  
  # Read a PDB file from the RCSB online database
  s1 <- read.pdb(number)
  
  # trim pdb to a subset of atoms and store in s1.chainA
  s1.chainA <- trim.pdb(s1, chain="A", elety="CA")
  
  # store data.frame containing atom data in s1.b
  s1.b <- s1.chainA$atom$b

  # generate protein plot
